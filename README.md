> You followed your conscience in the hope that others would follow theirs.
> You didn’t do it for a reward, or a pat on the head.

> The universe never tells us if we did right or wrong.
> It’s more important to try to help people than to know that you did.
> More important that someone else’s life gets better than for you to feel good about yourself.

> You never know the effect you might have on someone, not really.
> Maybe one core thing you said haunts them forever.
> Maybe one moment of kindness gives them comfort or courage.
> Maybe you said the one thing they needed to hear.

> It doesn’t matter if you never know.
> You just have to try.
